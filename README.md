# JavaFX Basic App (Plain Java + FXML)

A minimal JavaFX app that shows a button; when clicked, it displays a label with the text "You clicked on the button".

## Run (using Maven)

1. Ensure you have JDK 21+ and Maven installed.
2. From the project root (`/opt/javafx`):

```bash
mvn clean javafx:run
```

If your system requires an explicit JavaFX platform classifier (rare when using the plugin), see OpenJFX docs.

Enjoy!
